1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,880
Move 37; it's finally here.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,117
Hello world! It's Siraj.

3
00:00:05,117 --> 00:00:09,760
I've been teaching a course called
"Move 37" for the past ten weeks

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,084
I wanted to culminate it all

5
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:14,751
every RL technique we've talked about

6
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:16,540
with this one video.

7
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,284
I'm gonna explain what Move 37 is,

8
00:00:19,284 --> 00:00:23,000
and three reasons why it's so significant for our future,

9
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,480
in terms of human jobs, health, and lifestyle.

10
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,284
The Go board game is very popular
in large parts of Asia;

11
00:00:30,284 --> 00:00:34,880
it's very old and some players have
dedicated their entire lives to mastering it.

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,950
When polled, most AI researchers believed

13
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,183
it would take several decades for

14
00:00:40,183 --> 00:00:43,260
computers to reach the standard
of a human expert player.

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,851
It's a very challenging game,

16
00:00:45,851 --> 00:00:47,984
more potential board positions

17
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:50,080
than there are atoms in the universe.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,817
A player has to learn how to recognize

19
00:00:52,817 --> 00:00:57,200
abstract patterns in hundreds of pieces
placed across the board,

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,951
and even experts have a hard time explaining

21
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:04,080
why a particular move is
either benificial, or problematic.

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,384
So when DeepMind's AI program,

23
00:01:06,384 --> 00:01:07,950
called AlphaGo Zero,

24
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,983
beat the world champion at Go
much earlier than expected,

25
00:01:11,983 --> 00:01:13,200
history was made.

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,817
Starting with the training set
of recorded games

27
00:01:15,817 --> 00:01:20,000
that contained over 30 million moves
made by expert Go players,

28
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,817
the AlphaGo Zero algorithm used a model

29
00:01:22,817 --> 00:01:24,750
proven to be able to learn

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,350
from image data directly

31
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,800
called a Convolutional Neural Network.

32
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,117
It was fed a series of game states as input

33
00:01:31,117 --> 00:01:32,960
meaning the positions on the board.

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,784
The network learned how to
predict the next move,

35
00:01:35,784 --> 00:01:40,240
and learned to predict the outcome from
different arrangements on the board.

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,217
Since Go has so many potential moves,

37
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:46,320
a brute force search would take way too long;

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,651
even longer than it'll take Apple to release

39
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:50,560
an augmented reality device.

40
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,517
So instead, the convolutional network
was deployed

41
00:01:54,517 --> 00:01:57,184
in the context of a search algorithm

42
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:59,440
called a Monte Carlo Tree Search.

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,717
This tree search was used to initially explore

44
00:02:02,717 --> 00:02:04,960
many possible moves on the board,

45
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,884
then focus that exploration over time

46
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:11,751
as certain moves were found to be
more likely to lead to wins

47
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:12,640
than others.

48
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,051
AlphaGo used the neural network

49
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:17,484
to both predict moves to help guide

50
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:20,240
which branches of the game tree to search,

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,251
and it used it to evaluate the positions

52
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:25,840
it encountered during its search.

53
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,350
This allowed it to intelligently
search upcoming moves,

54
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,800
and ultimately beat
the world champion at the game.

55
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,483
But even more important than AlphaGo's win

56
00:02:35,483 --> 00:02:38,084
was one moment during the game;

57
00:02:38,084 --> 00:02:41,600
the moment that caused
Lee Sedol to leave the room.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,684
AlphaGo played this move,

59
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:46,284
which I wanna hear more about in a second, but,

60
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:49,183
Uh... Lee has left the room.

61
00:02:49,183 --> 00:02:51,440
He left the room after that move.

62
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,784
It was a move that seemed terrible
to everyone who saw it.

63
00:02:55,784 --> 00:03:00,400
But it turned out that Move 37
was an incredible move to play,

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,160
and it was instrumental
in helping AlphaGo win the game.

65
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,040
Somehow, a computer program knew something
about the game that we didn't.

66
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,960
Somehow, it's intuition was both different
 and better, than human intuition.

67
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,360
One of the players, Fan Hui, said:

68
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,360
AI thinks you're beautiful too, Fan. *winks*

69
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,651
Move 37 offered us a glimpse at
what an intelligence looks like

70
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:31,440
 that thinks differently than we do,

71
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,360
but is still very much capable of
accomplishing tasks.

72
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,750
Interestingly, Lee played his own move
in a later game with AlphaGo,

73
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,000
since they were playing through a series of them,

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,480
which helped him win one of the games.

75
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,117
Move 78, called the Divine Move,

76
00:03:47,117 --> 00:03:48,960
Brillaint Tesuji by some.

77
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,200
The designers of AlphaGo called it
a "one in ten-thousands move", because

78
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,817
AlphaGo calculated that there was
a probability of 1 out of 10,000

79
00:03:57,817 --> 00:03:59,440
that a human would play that move.

80
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,617
Lee's Move 78 caused AlphaGo to make

81
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,600
sub-optimal decisions in the next round.

82
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,084
Lee learned that AlphaGo was superior

83
00:04:08,084 --> 00:04:11,600
at playing the right moves
to optimize for small gains,

84
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,384
but it could fail in extreme situations

85
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:18,160
where the gain of points in one move
would be more important.

86
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,680
This was an example of
intelligence augmentation:

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,183
Better designed algorithms
lead to better performances,

88
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:29,120
and better performances help humans
make better decisions.

89
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,451
Humans who make better decisions

90
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:36,160
can create environments where
algorithms fail; i.e. "divine moves",

91
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,117
and learning about these failures

92
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:40,480
helps us design better algorithms.

93
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,850
The AlphaGo algorithm influence

94
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,040
Lee's gameplay, and vice versa.

95
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,651
We can work together

96
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:48,217
with this machine intelligence

97
00:04:48,217 --> 00:04:49,760
in many different ways,

98
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,050
to further extend our capabilities

99
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,160
across every industry.

100
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,750
This kind of technology can help us

101
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,450
achieve goals that we could not do alone,

102
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:00,880
and I'll outline the three biggest ones.

103
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,884
The first is healthcare;

104
00:05:02,884 --> 00:05:07,600
cancer, Alzheimer's, and a host of other
major diseases plague humanity,

105
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,550
many die every year because

106
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,280
our best scientists
haven't been able to find a cure.

107
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,017
In the USA, the path to develop a new medicine

108
00:05:16,017 --> 00:05:18,480
takes at least ten years on average,

109
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,000
and costs an average of $2.6 billion US dollars.

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,817
And less than 12% of the candidate medicines

111
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:29,360
that make it into phase 1 clinical trials
are approved by the FDA.

112
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,417
There are billions of possible lead molecules

113
00:05:32,417 --> 00:05:34,960
that could be used as potential cures,

114
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,951
so a scientist has to use their intuition

115
00:05:37,951 --> 00:05:41,484
to pick one that would most likely
have the desired properties

116
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:43,760
for curing the disease in question.

117
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,717
The process of synthesizing and
testing a single new molecule in a lab

118
00:05:48,717 --> 00:05:52,080
could cost thousands or
tens of thousands of dollars,

119
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,760
so the early stage guessing process
is really important.

120
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,284
We can use AI to help generate
a potential molecular structure,

121
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:03,360
say using a model like
Generative Adversarial Networks,

122
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,360
which have shown a lot of promise
generating different types of useful data.

123
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,984
In these dueling networks,

124
00:06:08,984 --> 00:06:12,320
where one progressively
becomes a better generator

125
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,517
by trying to fool the other into thinking

126
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:17,600
what it's generated is real
through a feedback loop,

127
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,750
feeding in vast quantities of molecular data

128
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,117
that no human could process all at once

129
00:06:22,117 --> 00:06:24,480
could result in some incredible advances.

130
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,017
And human scientists could test

131
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:28,400
what they've generated to see if it's a valid cure.

132
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,384
Along the way, they'd come up with
more clues in the right direction,

133
00:06:32,384 --> 00:06:34,480
tweaking their algorithm as they go along.

134
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:39,120
This is an example of the intelligence
augmentation process realized.

135
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,800
AI could also help offer a second diagnosi
 for a doctor to help aid in their diagnosis,

136
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,960
giving them yet another perspective to
consider to best help their patient.

137
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,683
The human body is itself
an extremely complicated system,

138
00:06:52,683 --> 00:06:54,720
absolutely rich with data.

139
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,584
AI can help us ask questions
that we never even thought to ask,

140
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,720
and help individual humans by learning
about their specific health needs,

141
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,440
delivering personalized medicine
or treatments when they need it.

142
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,320
The second is software design.

143
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,840
We humans are not the best at writing software.

144
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,750
And when a software project becomes big enough,

145
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,280
like say the Google Chrome browser,

146
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,683
it's hard for a single human, besides Jeff Dean,

147
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:25,600
to understand the entire code base.

148
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,351
Imagine; a form of programming,

149
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:30,480
where we give high level input to our machine,

150
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,400
and it decides on the
implementation details by itself.

151
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,284
Take consensus algorithms,

152
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:41,040
for example; the hype around cryptocurrencies
has been around for almost a decade now,

153
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,217
and we still haven't figured out a wa

154
00:07:43,217 --> 00:07:46,960
 to create a scale-able blockchain
consensus algorithm,

155
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,480
that doesn't demand so much electricity to run.

156
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,117
Proof-of-work is a human designed algorithm

157
00:07:53,117 --> 00:07:56,800
and so are the different blockchain
consensus mechanisms.

158
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,717
There's so much theory
that goes into designing these,

159
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:04,320
from economics to cryptography
to distributed systems,

160
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,920
to sometimes even physics.

161
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,717
It's a hard problem that will require

162
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:11,120
a radically different way of thinking
to come up with the solution;

163
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,800
perfect for an AI.

164
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,200
Google's AutoML is one example of
AI automated software design.

165
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,960
It learns how to tune hyper-parameters
for specific models,

166
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,760
and companies can use this all-in-one solution
to fit their business needs.

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,350
Just give it a data set, and an objective,

168
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,400
and in the ideal scenario,
it learns which model to use,

169
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,817
what its hyper-parameters should be,

170
00:08:34,817 --> 00:08:37,600
and how it should clean and regularize the data.

171
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,350
And this principle of AI assisted design

172
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,083
doesn't just have to apply to software;

173
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:44,400
it can be any creative endeavor.

174
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,517
Brandmark uses AI to generate a whole host of

175
00:08:47,517 --> 00:08:50,320
potential logos and themes for a new startup.

176
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,117
Just give it some initial parameters
of what you want,

177
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:56,000
and watch as it gives you many options.

178
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,017
And Google's Magenta project has resulted in
some very cool web demos

179
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:04,400
that let humans play music alongside AI.

180
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,200
The AI can learn your style of playing,
and adapt, and you can do the same.

181
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,960
In this way, the duet becomes
greater than the sum of its parts.

182
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,717
In fact, for any idea that we have,

183
00:09:15,717 --> 00:09:18,084
we can use AI to visualize it,

184
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:20,080
assess the different possibilities,

185
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,117
and pick the best one,

186
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:24,240
be it a scientific or creative endeavor.

187
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,120
And the third is a personal assistant.

188
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,884
The amount of data in the world doubles every two years.

189
00:09:30,884 --> 00:09:34,400
We are constantly getting flooded
with a whole host of options,

190
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,817
of content, of choices, from the Internet,

191
00:09:37,817 --> 00:09:41,280
and different algorithms
across the applications that we use

192
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,317
are constantly manipulating our behavior,

193
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:48,160
tweaking our opinions and
attention through subtle design tricks,

194
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,400
engineering the reward signals
that are native to human psychology,

195
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,417
to get us to do something;

196
00:09:54,417 --> 00:09:59,040
whether that's clicking on an ad
or buying a specific product,

197
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,617
we have to parse through
all this noise for ourselves,

198
00:10:02,617 --> 00:10:05,280
to see what is the most meaningful to us.

199
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
This is a very, very hard task.

200
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,250
A personal AI assistant, stored locally,

201
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,360
trained on our data, with a transparent backend,

202
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,517
could help us navigate the complexity of life

203
00:10:16,517 --> 00:10:18,640
in ways we did not think possible.

204
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,950
It could know us better than any human could,

205
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,360
concatenating data points about us,

206
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,717
from our web browsing history, to our heart rate;

207
00:10:26,717 --> 00:10:29,360
it could tell us how to best achieve our goals,

208
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,400
whether that's in fitness or
in school, in a career or in a relationship.

209
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,160
We can use this feedback
to help guide our own decisions.

210
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,950
Move 37 also catalyzed
the current AI renaissance

211
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,160
that China is currently undergoing.

212
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,717
In the West, Go isn't as common a game,

213
00:10:46,717 --> 00:10:49,760
but in China, it's a highly respected game,

214
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,584
many even believing that it's a sacred game,

215
00:10:52,584 --> 00:10:55,600
connecting humans
to the universe in its complexity.

216
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:01,350
AlphaGo defeating the world champion at a game
thought to be so sacred in China was huge;

217
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,720
bigger than in the West,

218
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,284
because the general population
is more familiar

219
00:11:06,284 --> 00:11:08,720
with just how complex the game is.

220
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,317
The Chinese government promptly created
an AI development plan

221
00:11:13,317 --> 00:11:16,383
to become the world leader in AI by 2030

222
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:18,960
and it's definitely executing on it.

223
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,840
Ultimately, automation technology will help
free humans from labor based jobs,

224
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,080
and create new classes of jobs
that we actually enjoy doing.

225
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,984
I hope you liked the video!

226
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:30,850
Please subscribe for more, and for now,

227
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,360
I've gotta try to play Go... somehow.

228
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,960
So... thanks for watching!
